Example code/testbench in WeatherListenerTestGUI project

Usage:

1. using IEEEWeather;
2. Instantiate a WeatherListener and register event handler
3. WeatherListener.Start();
4. Listen for events

Event passes a WeatherUpdate object that contains various WeatherValues
WeatherValues implicitly convert to and from floats.

Numbers in WeatherValues are in a default unit.
Some WeatherValue dervied classes (TemperatureValue, etc) have conversions to other units.
	ex TemperatureValue.ToF();  // default unit is in C
